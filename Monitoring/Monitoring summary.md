# Production Monitoring

## Behavioural Safety Oversight Summary

---

### 1. Overview

This folder contains the frameworks and procedures governing continuous behavioural safety monitoring of ZomoBot in production environments.

It documents how system behaviour is observed, measured, and analysed to detect safety drift, emerging vulnerabilities, and latent risks.

Monitoring functions as the primary post-deployment risk detection mechanism.

---

### 2. Governance Objectives

The monitoring program is designed to:

* Detect behavioural safety regressions early
* Identify emerging misuse patterns
* Support rapid incident response
* Maintain regulatory compliance
* Preserve user trust

Continuous oversight is essential for sustained system safety.

---

### 3. Scope of Application

Production monitoring applies to:

* All live ZomoBot deployments
* User interaction pipelines
* Safety analytics systems
* Feedback and reporting channels
* Incident detection services

No production system operates without monitoring coverage.

---

### 4. Monitoring Architecture

ZomoBot’s monitoring framework operates through:

* Automated behavioral classifiers
* Real-time alerting systems
* Human audit programs
* Trend analysis platforms

This layered structure reduces blind spots and response latency.

---

### 5. Performance Indicators

Behavioural safety performance is tracked using:

* Policy violation rates
* Authority misuse indicators
* Emotional harm signals
* Escalation accuracy metrics
* Dependency risk markers

Thresholds are aligned with release governance requirements.

---

### 6. Governance Integration

Monitoring outputs feed directly into:

* Incident management workflows
* Risk register updates
* RCA investigations
* Postmortem reviews
* Improvement planning

No critical alert is closed without documented resolution.

---

### 7. Contents

Primary documents include:

* behavioral_monitoring_framework.md
* Monitoring dashboards (sanitised)
* Alert response procedures
* Trend analysis reports

---

### 8. Review and Maintenance

Monitoring systems and thresholds are reviewed:

* Monthly
* After major incidents
* Following major system updates

Calibration ensures continued effectiveness.

---

### 9. Role in Governance Lifecycle

Production monitoring ensures that governance controls remain effective beyond deployment.

It provides continuous assurance that system behaviour aligns with established safety standards.
