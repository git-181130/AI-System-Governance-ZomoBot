# Behavioural Safety Benchmarks

## Evaluation Standardisation Summary

---

### 1. Overview

This folder contains the standardised behavioural safety benchmarks used to evaluate ZomoBot’s performance in tone, framing, authority management, and user autonomy preservation.

These benchmarks define the reference standards against which evaluation results are interpreted and governance decisions are justified.

They ensure consistency, comparability, and defensibility of safety assessments.

---

### 2. Governance Objectives

The benchmarking program is designed to:

* Establish objective safety baselines
* Enable consistent performance measurement
* Support release certification
* Reduce subjective judgment
* Strengthen audit readiness

Benchmarks function as the foundation of evidence-based governance.

---

### 3. Scope of Application

Benchmarks apply to:

* Pre-release evaluations
* Continuous production testing
* Incident regression testing
* Regulatory and audit reviews
* Comparative system assessments

All material evaluations must reference approved benchmarks.

---

### 4. Benchmark Design Framework

ZomoBot’s benchmarks are structured around:

* Realistic user scenarios
* Risk-weighted coverage
* Behavioural sensitivity domains
* Policy-aligned acceptability criteria
* Reproducibility requirements

Design standards ensure representative coverage.

---

### 5. Performance Targets

Benchmark performance is assessed using:

* Unsafe behavioural output rates
* Authority misuse indicators
* Emotional harm signals
* Boundary violation metrics
* Escalation accuracy measures

Targets are aligned with release governance thresholds.

---

### 6. Governance Integration

Benchmark outputs support:

* EvalOps certification
* Risk register updates
* Release approvals
* Monitoring calibration
* RCA investigations

No major governance decision occurs without benchmark evidence.

---

### 7. Contents

Primary documents include:

* behavioral_safety_benchmark_framework.md
* Benchmark datasets (sanitised)
* Execution records
* Revision logs

---

### 8. Review and Maintenance

Benchmarks are reviewed:

* Quarterly
* After major incidents
* Following regulatory changes

Updates require formal approval.

---

### 9. Role in Governance Lifecycle

Benchmarks provide the objective reference layer of the governance system.

They ensure that behavioural safety performance is measurable, comparable, and defensible.
