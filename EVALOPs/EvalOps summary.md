## Behavioural Safety Assurance Summary

---

### 1. Overview

This folder contains the Evaluation Operations (EvalOps) frameworks and procedures used to assess ZomoBot’s behavioural safety performance throughout its lifecycle.

EvalOps functions as the primary quality assurance and early-warning system for detecting tone misuse, authority escalation, emotional harm risks, and boundary violations.

It ensures that behavioral safety is continuously measured, validated, and enforced.

---

### 2. Governance Objectives

The EvalOps program is designed to:

* Detect behavioural safety failures before deployment
* Prevent unsafe system releases
* Support evidence-based governance decisions
* Reduce incident frequency
* Maintain regulatory and audit readiness

EvalOps transforms policy requirements into measurable system controls.

---

### 3. Scope of Application

EvalOps applies to:

* Model training and fine-tuning cycles
* Prompt and instruction updates
* Safety system modifications
* Feature launches
* Incident remediation testing
* Production regression validation

All system changes with behavioural impact are subject to evaluation.

---

### 4. Evaluation Architecture

ZomoBot’s EvalOps framework operates through a multi-layer structure:

* Automated behavioural classifiers
* Structured human expert reviews
* Adversarial and misuse testing
* Risk-weighted scenario analysis

This layered approach reduces blind spots and systemic bias.

---

### 5. Performance Measurement

Behavioural safety performance is assessed using:

* Policy violation rates
* Authority misuse indicators
* Emotional impact scores
* Escalation accuracy metrics
* Uncertainty communication measures

Thresholds are defined and enforced through release governance.

---

### 6. Governance Integration

EvalOps outputs directly inform:

* Risk register updates
* Release approval decisions
* Monitoring calibration
* Incident investigations
* Improvement initiatives

No material governance decision occurs without the evaluation of evidence.

---

### 7. Contents

Primary documents include:

* behavioral_evalops_framework.md
* Evaluation procedures
* Scenario libraries
* Validation records

---

### 8. Review and Maintenance

EvalOps frameworks are reviewed:

* Monthly for high-risk systems
* Quarterly for standard systems
* After major incidents

Continuous refinement ensures relevance and effectiveness.

---

### 9. Role in Governance Lifecycle

EvalOps represents the operational bridge between policy intent and system reality.

It ensures that behavioural safety standards are enforceable, verifiable, and continuously improved.
