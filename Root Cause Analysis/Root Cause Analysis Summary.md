## Behavioral Safety Failure Investigation Summary

---

### 1. Overview

This folder contains the frameworks and analytical records used to investigate the underlying causes of behavioral safety incidents and systemic governance failures within ZomoBot.

It documents how technical, procedural, and organizational contributors are identified and addressed.

RCA functions as the primary mechanism for transforming incidents into durable system improvements.

---

### 2. Governance Objectives

The RCA program is designed to:

* Identify systemic contributors to failures
* Prevent recurrence of incidents
* Strengthen governance controls
* Support regulatory defensibility
* Promote organizational learning

RCA emphasizes prevention over attribution.

---

### 3. Scope of Application

RCA applies to:

* All critical and high-severity incidents
* Recurrent medium-severity failures
* Major policy violations

No material incident is closed without completed analysis.

---

### 4. Analytical Methodology

ZomoBot’s RCA framework employs:

* Incident reconstruction
* Evidence-based review
* Causal chain analysis
* Control gap assessment
* Process mapping techniques

Multiple methods reduce analytical bias.

---

### 5. Root Cause Classification

Identified causes are categorized into:

* Technical failures
* Process deficiencies
* Governance weaknesses
* Human and training gaps
* External influences

Classification supports targeted remediation.

---

### 6. Governance Integration

RCA findings directly inform:

* Policy revisions
* EvalOps enhancements
* Risk register updates
