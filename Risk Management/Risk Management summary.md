# Risk Management

## Behavioural Safety Risk Governance Summary

---

### 1. Overview

This folder contains the formal risk management frameworks and registers governing behavioural safety risks associated with ZomoBot’s operation.

It documents how behavioural, emotional, and authority-related risks are identified, assessed, prioritised, mitigated, and monitored across the system lifecycle.

Risk management functions as the central coordination mechanism for governance decision-making.

---

### 2. Governance Objectives

The risk management program is designed to:

* Systematically identify material behavioural risks
* Quantify user and organisational exposure
* Assign clear accountability
* Drive targeted mitigation strategies
* Support regulatory and legal defensibility

It ensures that safety risks are addressed proactively rather than reactively.

---

### 3. Scope of Application

Risk management applies to:

* Product design and feature development
* Model and prompt updates
* Evaluation outcomes
* Incident findings
* Regulatory changes
* External risk signals

All governance-relevant risks must be recorded and tracked.

---

### 4. Risk Assessment Framework

ZomoBot’s risk assessment process evaluates each risk across:

* User harm potential
* Likelihood of occurrence
* Legal and compliance exposure
* Reputational impact
* Operational disruption

Risks are scored, categorised, and prioritised accordingly.

---

### 5. Risk Control and Mitigation

Risk mitigation is implemented through:

* Policy constraints
* EvalOps validation
* Release gating
* Monitoring systems
* Incident response protocols

Mitigation effectiveness is reviewed regularly.

### 6. Governance Integration

Risk management outputs directly support:

* Release review decisions
* Monitoring alert thresholds
* RCA investigations
* Postmortem reviews
* Continuous improvement planning

The risk register serves as the authoritative governance reference.

---

### 7. Contents

Primary documents include:

* risk_register.md
* Risk assessment guidelines
* Mitigation tracking records
* Escalation protocols

---

### 8. Review and Maintenance

Risk registers and controls are reviewed:

* Monthly
* After major incidents
* Following regulatory updates

High-risk items receive executive oversight.

---

### 9. Role in Governance Lifecycle

Risk management translates evaluation findings into structured governance action.

It ensures that behavioural safety risks are visible, owned, and continuously controlled.
