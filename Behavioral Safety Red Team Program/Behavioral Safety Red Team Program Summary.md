## Adversarial Testing and Misuse Resilience Summary

---

### 1. Overview

This folder contains the frameworks, methodologies, and findings of ZomoBot’s Behavioural Safety Red Team program.

It documents how adversarial testing is used to identify manipulation, panic induction, authority exploitation, and dependency formation risks before they affect real users.

The Red Team program functions as a critical stress-testing mechanism within the governance lifecycle.

---

### 2. Governance Objectives

The Red Team program is designed to:

* Proactively surface misuse and manipulation risks
* Test system resilience under adversarial conditions
* Identify hidden behavioural vulnerabilities
* Strengthen preventive controls
* Support regulatory preparedness

Adversarial testing complements standard evaluation methods.

---

### 3. Scope of Application

Red Team testing applies to:

* High-risk system releases
* New behavioural features
* Post-incident investigations
* Regulatory readiness reviews
* Emerging threat assessments

All major behavioural controls are subject to adversarial validation.

---

### 4. Threat Modelling Framework

ZomoBot’s Red Team program is structured around formal threat models, including:

* Authority exploitation scenarios
* Panic and fear amplification attacks
* Trust and dependency manipulation
* Vulnerability targeting techniques
* Boundary circumvention attempts

Threat modeling guides test design.

---

### 5. Testing Methodologies

Adversarial testing is conducted using:

* Multi-turn escalation scenarios
* Emotional priming techniques
* Context manipulation attacks
* Role-based deception methods
* Cultural and linguistic stress tests

These methods simulate real-world misuse patterns.

---

### 6. Governance Integration

Red Team findings directly inform:

* EvalOps enhancements
* Risk register updates
* Policy amendments
* Release gate adjustments
* Monitoring improvements

Critical findings block deployment until resolved.

### 7. Contents

Primary documents include:

* behavioral_red_team_framework.md
* Adversarial test scenarios
* Sanitised interaction transcripts
* Mitigation recommendations

---

### 8. Review and Maintenance

Red Team programs are reviewed:

* Quarterly
* After major incidents
* Following significant system changes

Continuous refinement maintains effectiveness.

---

### 9. Role in Governance Lifecycle

The Red Team program serves as the organisation’s primary defence against worst-case behavioural misuse.

It ensures that governance controls are resilient under real-world adversarial pressure.
