# AI-System-Governance-ZomoBot
End-to-end AI behavioural safety and governance system for a human-centred food companion.

## Public Governance Demonstration Disclaimer

This repository presents a **simulated but professionally structured AI governance system** based on real evaluation work conducted on ZomoBot’s behavioural safety.

To protect users, intellectual property, and organisational security:

* Internal system prompts are not disclosed
* Model architectures are not exposed
* Proprietary metrics are anonymised
* Security-sensitive controls are omitted
* Exact deployment configurations are withheld

All materials are presented for **professional demonstration and portfolio purposes** and reflect industry-aligned governance practices.

This repository does not represent a live production system.

## Portfolio Context

This repository demonstrates how I designed and operated an end-to-end AI system governance lifecycle for a human-centred food companion serving over 50,000 users.

The framework covers:

* Behavioural safety policy design
* Evaluation Operations (EvalOps)
* Risk registration and mitigation
* Release governance and approval
* Production monitoring
* Incident management
* Root cause analysis (RCA)
* Organisational learning
* Continuous improvement

The primary focus is on preventing behavioural harm, panic induction, and authority misuse in health-adjacent AI systems.

**Role:** Governance Lead – AI Safety & Operations

##  System Overview

ZomoBot is a human-centred AI companion designed to support users in food, nutrition, and lifestyle decision-making.

Because of its health-adjacent role and scale of deployment, ZomoBot operates under heightened ethical, legal, and operational obligations.

This governance framework ensures that:

* User autonomy is preserved
* Emotional and behavioural safety is protected
* Regulatory exposure is minimised
* System risks are continuously managed

Governance is treated as a core operational function, not a compliance formality.

---

##  Governance Lifecycle

ZomoBot operates a continuous governance loop:

**Policy → EvalOps → Risk → Review → Monitoring → Incident → RCA → Postmortem → Improvement**

Each stage reinforces system safety, accountability, and long-term resilience.
