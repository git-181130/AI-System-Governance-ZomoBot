## Behavioral Safety Failure Analysis Summary

---

### 1. Overview

This document provides a consolidated overview of documented behavioral safety incident case studies involving ZomoBot.

It explains how real and simulated failure events are analyzed, managed, and transformed into governance improvements.

Incident case studies serve as practical evidence of the system’s accountability and learning capacity.

---

### 2. Governance Objectives

The incident case study program is designed to:

* Demonstrate transparent handling of failures
* Validate incident management procedures
* Support regulatory and audit reviews
* Enable organizational learning
* Strengthen preventive controls

Case studies convert abstract governance principles into operational practice.

---

### 3. Scope of Application

Incident case studies cover:

* Pre-release safety failures
* Production behavioral regressions
* Misuse and panic-induction events
* Boundary and authority violations
* Near-miss incidents

Both confirmed and prevented incidents are documented.

---

### 4. Case Study Selection Criteria

Incidents are selected for documentation based on:

* Severity of user impact
* Governance relevance
* Learning potential
* Systemic implications
* Regulatory sensitivity

Not all incidents are published as case studies.

---

### 5. Documentation Structure

Each case study includes:

* Incident overview
* Detection method
* Impact assessment
* Response actions
* RCA summary
* Corrective measures
* Governance outcomes

This structure ensures consistency.

---

### 6. Governance Integration

Case study findings inform:

* Policy updates
* EvalOps enhancements
* Risk register revisions
* Release governance rules
* Monitoring adjustments
* Improvement initiatives

Learning is institutionalized.

---

### 7. Contents

Current documented case studies include:

* incident_001_tone_misuse.md
* Future behavioral safety incident records

---

### 8. Review and Maintenance

Case study documentation is reviewed:

* After each major incident
* During quarterly governance reviews
* Following regulatory inquiries

Updates require formal approval.

---

### 9. Role in Governance Lifecycle

Incident case studies represent the practical validation layer of the governance system.

They demonstrate how governance controls perform under real-world conditions and how failures lead to structural improvement.
